=head1 USAGE
  
# 0. use Global::MutexLock;  
  
    use Global::MutexLock qw(mutex_create mutex_destory mutex_lock mutex_unlock);   
  
# 1. create a new global mutex id  
# tips: you can create an id, and use it in different crons or apps  
  
    my $mutex_id = mutex_create();  
  
# 2. take a lock  
  
    unless (mutex_lock($mutex_id)) {  
        warn "lock error";  
    }  
  
# 3. do something...  
# ...  
  
# 4. release lock  
  
    unless (mutex_unlock($mutex_id)) {  
        warn "release lock error";  
    }  
  
# 5. destory mutex lock id  
# you must do it. otherwise the IPC id will be leaved in system.  
# or you can rm it by `ipcrm -m IPCID`  
# you can find IPCID by `ipcs`  
  
    mutex_destory($mutex_id);
